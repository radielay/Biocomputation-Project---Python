# Biocomputation-Project---Python
This project is the coursework for Biocomputation - a final year module in Computer Science.
The project consists of tests and experimentation on the minima and maxima of the Genetic Algorithm, using different methods for selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness functions. There is a report included that goes over the reluts and shows a comparison between the GA and the Firefly Algorithm.
